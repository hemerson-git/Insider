# React Prime

### An App that will make your life easier, when trying to find details about a movie or see what's in theaters.

This Project has been developed on "React Insider Week 4", given by [Sujeito Programador]("https://www.youtube.com/c/Sujeitoprogramador"). To develop this app I've used the following technologies: TypeScript, React Native, Styled-components and Expo. And [TMDB API]('https://developers.themoviedb.org/3') to get the movies informations.
